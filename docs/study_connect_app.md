# StudyConnect Application

This document outlines the initial expectations and context for the development of StudyConnect.

## Purpose and Scope
StudyConnect helps students capture, organize, and monitor their learning commitments while enabling lightweight collaboration within study groups. It is a student-centered productivity tool used for educational purposes in the Software Testing course.

## Target Users and Context
- Individual students planning homework, exam preparation, and project milestones
- Small study groups coordinating shared work and preparing for exams together

## Core Features

### Personal task and goal management
- Create tasks with title, deadline, priority, notes
- Categorize tasks (e.g., “Mathematics,” “Exam Prep,” “Group Project”)
- Track progress states (e.g., open, in progress, completed)
- Maintain a clear overview of parallel learning goals

### Study groups and collaboration
- Create or join groups, invite members, and assign tasks
- Support basic moderation by group administrators
- Keep discussions close to work via task-linked comments and messaging

### Deadlines and awareness
- Link tasks and group activities to specific dates
- Highlight upcoming and overdue work
- Provide supportive (non-intrusive) reminders/notifications

### Motivation and exports
- Offer engagement elements (e.g., progress points or badges)
- Export schedules and plans to PDF or calendar files (ICS)

## Architecture and Platform Principles
- Lightweight and modular design to remain manageable and extensible
- Accessible across web, mobile, and potentially desktop platforms
- Enable future integrations with external learning platforms or institutional systems

## Non-Goals
StudyConnect is not intended to be a full project management suite. The focus is on simplicity, student needs, and collaboration at small scale.

## High-Level Expectations (for requirements engineering)
1. Simplicity and Usability
   - Provide an intuitive UI allowing quick task creation and management without prior training.
2. Support for Individual and Group Task Management
   - Enable organizing and monitoring personal tasks and collaborating within groups.
3. Role- and Permission Management
   - Distinguish between members and administrators for clear assignment and moderation.
4. Awareness of Deadlines and Progress
   - Reflect progress states and deadlines clearly to support prioritization and time management.
5. Motivation and Engagement
   - Include positive reinforcement without distracting from learning objectives.
6. Accessibility and Integration
   - Ensure cross-device accessibility and support exports (PDF, ICS) for workflow integration.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker Desktop**: For running containerized services.
- **Python 3.12**: For the backend application.
- **Node.js & npm**: For the frontend React application.
- **Git**: For version control.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository and create virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Luka0103/studyconnect.git
    cd studyconnect
    python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    - Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
    - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    - Navigate to the UI directory: `cd ../ui`
    - Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Environment Configuration
The project requires a `.env` file in the root directory for local environment variables. An example is provided in `.env.example`.

1.  Create your local configuration by copying the example file: `cp .env.example .env`
2.  Open the new `.env` file and adjust the placeholder values. The Keycloak secrets must be obtained from the admin console of your running Keycloak instance.


### App execution
1.  **Start Infrastructure Services**: From the root directory, start Postgres, pgAdmin, and Keycloak using Docker Compose:
    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```
2.  **Run the Backend**: In the `backend` directory with your virtual environment activated, start the backend with `python -m backend.api`
3.  **Run the Frontend**: In the `ui` directory, start the Frontend with `npm run dev`

### Test execution
Both unit and BDD tests have a `.ini` file, so they can be executed from CLI without the need to pass respective filenames or directories.

To run all unit tests, use the following command:
```sh
pytest
```

To run all BDD tests, use the following command:
```sh
behave
```
