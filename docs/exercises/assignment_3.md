### Task 3.3

| UX Factor | Why is the factor important? | Designs or features to support this factor | What if factor is ignored? |
|----------|---|---|---|
| Bequemlichkeit (Convenience) | Making common tasks in the Study-Connect app fast and effortless makes the user use the app more regularly. It also reduces the mental overhead needed to plan, start or update tasks. | Key features of implementing this factor are foremost a fast and easy task creation and handling. It should be possible to create a task with just a title, with an optional deadline which can be changed later. A task status should be able to get changed with a single tap without opening details. Presets for deadlines, e.g. in one week, 2 weeks, one month etc. | If adding or updating tasks feels slow and tedious, students will avoid the app. This could cause students to not recommend the app to peers, or even revert to other, already existing options, effectively abandoning the app. |
| Effizienz (Efficiency) | Students often have limited, fragmented study time. Efficient workflows let them plan or update tasks in short breaks. Also, students will frequently check/update existing tasks. Slow or overloaded interfaces make the interactions tedious. | Fast, responsive UI and optimistic updates. Show success immedmediately, synchronise the app in the background. This makes the app feel instant. Implement reocurring tasks templates, e.g clone an existing task to a new one. | A non-efficient app could lead to increased user frustration, as laggy interactions and long, unclear processes cause frustration, leading to negative perceptions of the app. |
| Übersichtlichkeit (Overall) | By finding and navigating the application  faster the user is more time efficient and will likely use it more often. | A simple User Interface with minimal distraction will allow the User to have a good overview of the features. Contrast colors and fitting Icons or Keywords will allow the user to quckly find what he needs. | A messy or overfilled application could lead to increased frustration and a bad image. The user might not want to engage with the application. |
| Intuitive Bedienung (Intuitie Operation) | The user should not need extra instructions to use the application. Aiding in upholding Efficiency and Convenience. | The application desing should concentrate on fitting, common icons and menus designs. It should use common locations of features which can be aquired by design guidlines and common practises. | When the user can't find features where he thinks they should be the convenience gets lowered and the user might look if there are better alternaties on the market. |
| Stimulation | When stimulated the user wants to engage more with the product. | Some playfull features for the users to gain motivation besides the main objective will stimulate them. | Without the stimulating part the product will be like most other products on the market. It won't stand out. And users might find the competition more attractive. |
