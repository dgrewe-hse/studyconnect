|         Requirements                  |      /docs/Assignment_2_Reqs_and_Quality_Goals.md    |     Requirements are not uniqely identifiable. |  B2  |        Annabel       |      Low   |        |         |                   |
| Requirements    | /docs/Assignment_2_Reqs_and_Quality_Goals.md  – User Management, Req. 1           | The requirement “The system shall allow users to register and log in securely.” is not testable as written. “Securely” is undefined (no criteria like hashing, password rules, or transport security).  | B7 | Annabel | Medium|  | | | 
| Requiremnets | /docs/Assignment_2_Reqs_and_Quality_Goals.md  – Deadline and Progress Awareness, Req.3 | The description “non-intrusive reminders” is not verifyable. What counts as non-intrusive or intrusive?  | B7 | Annabel | Medium | | | |
| Requirements | /docs/Assignment_2_Reqs_and_Quality_Goals.md - |  Export of data to PDF/ICS is mentioned under “Task and Goal Management” and again under “Accessibility and Integration”. This duplication may lead to inconsistencies later. | B6 | Annabel | Low | | | |
