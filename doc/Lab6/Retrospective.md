# Retrospective

## What went well?
- Encouraging and respectful meetings
- Review Meeting itself
- Review for Introduction Text and Requirements, because we were already familiar with those from our own project
- We learned something about the steps of a review, even though not all parts were executed perfectly 


## What didnt go as well?
- Time Mangement -> As peers we structure our work for the project more freely and spontaneously. However this lab was supposed to use set meeting times, which we often postponed or did on different dates than planned
- Not assigning clear scopes for each reviewer (per say not a problem, but would have been a better structure for the review. Doesnt fit the templates for example.)
- Decision making for checklists (Ours changed over time)
- We were often unsure what points to include in the checklist
- Review of code base was a bit more tricky. Getting familiar with the other teams code while focusing on the important parts and not loosing track

## Are reviews a suiteable method for our team? If so for what area would we use them for ?
- For requirements a review is only suiteable if we receive it before starting to code
- The reiew was good for our team to get used to inspecting other peoples code
- In this scenario of our lab it is however more suitebale to receive a review, than to be the reviewing team. This way you can know what mistakes you made in your project. In our experience, it was a little difficult to do a reiew for the first time, because we did not know what to focus on exactly.
